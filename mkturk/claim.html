            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <blockquote>The task here is to annotate a tweet in relation to a set of topics. Here the tweet can contain a claim that might be relevant to any one of the topics.<br/> Each tweet can be relevant for more than one of the topics, but it can also not be relevant for any one of the topics and should be annotated as such. Therefore, select the topics in which you find the tweet contains a claim relevant to an argument in a debate or communication campaign about the topic (regardless of your views on the claim and the topic and whether you would use it).<br/>
                <strong class="text-danger">More specific instructions and examples follow below, please read them carefully</strong></blockquote>
            
            <br/>
                        A claim is a standpoint toward a topic being discussed either directly or indirectly. The claim should be able to clearly be identified in a tweet on its own without relying on an assumption from the reader. This is an important issue for response tweets as the user might implicitly support a claim relevant to the topic or add a claim to a stance on the topic. Such tweets should not be annotated as containing a claim. <br/>
                        <span class="text-danger">The claim should also clearly have a positive or negative stance toward the discussed topic.</span> <br/> Implicit claims are different from explicit ones as they lack the syntactic connection to the topic. 
                        This means they omit parts of the discussed topic or have no direct connection to it; instead, they indirectly express a stance towards it. An example of this could be a tweet, "Gardening has been great for my family and me! Can't wait to collect the bounties of this year's harvest" which contains an implicit claim with a clear stance towards the topics "Plant based food should be encouraged" and "Vegan and vegetarian diets should be encouraged".
                   <br/> <br/>
                    Suppose the tweet contains a claim clearly discussing a different topic unrelated to any of the other topics. It should then be labeled with the "unrelated or no claim label" If the tweet does not contain a claim at all, then it should also be marked with the "unrelated or no claim label."
            
                <br/><strong>Examples:</strong>
            <table class="table table-condensed table-striped table-responsive">
                <colgroup>
                    <col class="col-xs-6 col-md-6" />
                    <col class="col-xs-2 col-md-2" />
                    <col class="col-xs-4 col-md-4" />
                </colgroup>

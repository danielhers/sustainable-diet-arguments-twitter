            <blockquote>The task here is to annotate tweets in relation to a topic where you have to annotate what kind of evidence a tweet contains if any.<br/> Evidence is a statement used to support or attack a topic or claim. This can be done in combination with a claim, or it can also be self contained if it is just stating facts or referencing studies related to the topic. If the evidence is not related to the discussed topic, it is marked as unrelated. There excits different types of evidence, and if a tweet contains any evidence should have the type of it annotated. If more than one type of evidence exists choose the type you think best describes the evidence in the tweet overall</blockquote>

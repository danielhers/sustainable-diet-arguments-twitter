            <blockquote>The task here is to annotate tweets related to a topic where you have to annotate what kind of evidence a tweet contains.<br/> Evidence is a statement used to support or attack a topic or claim. Evidence can be present in combination with a claim, or it can also be self-contained if it is just stating facts or referencing studies related to the topic. If the evidence is unrelated to the discussed topic, it is marked as unrelated. There exist different types of evidence, and if a tweet contains any evidence, it should have the kind of evidence annotated. If more than one type of evidence exists in the tweet, choose the type you think best describes main piece of evidence in the tweet that is relevant for the topic. <br/><br/> Be aware that the same tweet can show up multiple times and that each time it might have to be annotated differently for its evidence depending on the topic. Some tweets include various types of evidence where parts of the evidence are only relevant for one topic but not another. Therefore one tweet might have normative evidence for one topic but expert evidence for another and no evidence for a third.<br/> <strong>Remember, your goal is to annotate what type of evidence is in the tweet and if the evidence could be used in debate/argument or public communication both for or against the specified topic. Regardless of your views on the topic and whether the evidence is true or not.</strong></blockquote>
